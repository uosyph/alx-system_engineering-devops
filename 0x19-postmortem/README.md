# Introduction:

A postmortem report is a document that analyzes a recent event, typically a project failure or incident,to identify the root causes and learn from mistakes.
Postmortem reports are essential for continuous improvement and can help teams avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.

This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by Google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts:

- [Issue summary](#issue-summary)
- [Timeline](#timeline)
- [Root cause](#root-cause)
- [Resolution and recovery](#resolution-and-recovery)
- [Corrective and preventative measures](#corrective-and-preventative-measures)

## Issue summary

On August 18, 2023, a critical issue was detected in the software system, causing a complete service outage.
Users were unable to access the application, resulting in significant disruption and loss of functionality.
The root cause of this incident was identified as a database failure, leading to the unavailability of crucial data.

## Timeline

The issue was first reported on August 18, 2023, at 10:30 AM UTC when users started experiencing errors while interacting with the application.
The problem escalated rapidly, and by 10:45 AM UTC, the service became completely unavailable.
The incident response team was immediately notified and began investigating the cause of the outage.

## Root cause

After an in-depth analysis of the incident, the root cause was identified as a database failure.
The primary database server experienced a hardware malfunction, resulting in the loss of connectivity and the inability to retrieve or store data.
The failure was exacerbated by the lack of a robust backup system, which further hindered the recovery process.

## Resolution and recovery

To resolve the issue and restore service functionality, the following steps were taken:

1. The incident response team quickly initiated a failover to a secondary database server to restore data access.
2. Database administrators worked diligently to repair the malfunctioning hardware and restore the primary database server to full functionality.
3. A temporary workaround was implemented to minimize the impact on users while the resolution process was underway.
4. Once the primary database server was repaired and tested, a carefully planned fail-back process was executed to restore the system to its normal configuration.

The recovery process took approximately four hours, and by 3:00 PM UTC, the application was fully functional again.

## Corrective and preventative measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the system's resilience, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:

1. Implement a robust backup strategy to ensure data redundancy and facilitate faster recovery in the event of a failure.
2. Conduct regular hardware health checks and maintenance to identify and address potential issues before they escalate.
3. Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively detect database failures and other critical system components.
4. Develop and test a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to streamline the recovery process and minimize downtime.
5. Conduct post-incident reviews to learn from the incident and identify areas for further improvement.

By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance the system's reliability, minimize the impact of future incidents, and ensure a seamless user experience.
